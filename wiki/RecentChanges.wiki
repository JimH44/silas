#summary Summary of recent changes, to version 2.05-1.023
Revision History for Silas.DOT

=NEEDED=

 * Provide drop-down list of 3-letter booknames in ID form?--only aesthetic value during setup; the bookname isn't used for anything nor is it visible (except for ID footers in Proofs). We could do it with a txt file such as	Recent_Styles.txt.
 * Add horizontal rule between intro and Scr text even if single-column?
 * (eventually) add custom `\z*` style support, probably copy the style into the template so it doesn't hang up, perhaps open edit style dialog to format char styles right.
 * check into more automated picture placement (see Toolbox macro by Steve White)

 * Button in Proofs dialog to bring up checking table for editing.
 * Inserted checking table is resized to fit margins, like old v was.
 * Install: if Custom_styles.txt and Checking Table.doc are already in template folder, they're not saved and overwritten.

 * Checking table in ID footers now comes from an included file in template folder that people can edit. Install protects their version in "old versions" folder.
 * Custom_styles.txt now copied to Pt settings folder, and preserved in "old versions" during updates.

Changed Install Silas to check global variable before offering to install booklet macros.

==Silas 2.05-1.018 by Jim, 11 Jan 2007==

-Perhaps add key(s) to Inifile to note out-of-date stylenames -- done.

-Fixed addition of ID line and bookname that could end up in Verse Number style.

==Silas 2.05-1.016 by Jim, 9 Jan 2007==
Cropped picture of final message in "Install Silas.doc" so it wouldn't look like a button people could click.

-CreateIniFile in LangData needs to be updated so it won't make [SilasVersion] any more. -- fixed.
-add messages if Recent_Styles.txt or Original_Styles.txt are called. -- done.

-TE_Styles.txt now looks as if it should handle all the styles that come out of TE in an RTF.

==Silas 2.05-1.015 by Kim, 31 Dec 2006==
Fixed problem with footnote spacing. Also made Footer and checking table styles stay single-spaced.

Fixed problem with Booklet Macro installation.

Changed Latest_Styles.txt to Custom_Styles.txt. This control file is used for customizing USFM standard, so 
it's labeled accordingly. The other control files are used for updating to the latest "Standard" stylenames
in USFM.STY as distributed by the PT team.

Added subs ZoomSet and ZoomRecall to return to previous view.zoom after running jobs. Cleaned up subs to use
ZoomSet at start, and SetDefaultView (which calls ZoomRecall among other things) rather than 
ActiveDocument...View=PageOrPrintView at end of subs. Then if user sets a different zoom it won't change 
after every job. Also cleaned up a few places where screen updating caused a flashing image 
(switched order of calls at end of some subs).
