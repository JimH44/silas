#summary Summary of recent changes, to version 2.05-1.032
Revision History for Silas.DOT

=NEEDED=

 * Provide drop-down list of 3-letter booknames in ID form?--only aesthetic value during  setup; the bookname isn't used for anything nor is it visible (except for ID footers in Proofs). We could do it with a txt file such as	Recent_Styles.txt.
 * Add horizontal rule between intro and Scr text even if single-column?
 * (eventually) add custom `\z*` style support, probably copy the style into the template so it doesn't hang up, perhaps open edit style dialog to format char styles right.
 * check into more automated picture placement (see Toolbox macro by Steve White)

=Recent changes=
==Silas 2.05-1.032 by Jim, 12 Feb 2007==
 * Calling SetPathVariables more often to make sure variables are set.
 * Booklet Macros button renamed to Print booklet.
 * FAQ file updated.
 * Scripture menu now has item to display Print Booklet macro document, for its instructions.
 * Fixed: HeaderOther doesn't update to Inifile

==Silas 2.05-1.031 by Kim, 10 Feb 2007==
 * Added menu item "Read about printing booklets", opens Word Booklet Macros.doc.
 * Widened all text boxes & labels in dialogs (forms) so hi-res monitors don't choke on them.
 * Fixed bug in HalfPage dialog, and added context to "Install Booklet Macros" so it's disabled if they're installed already (but you can still open the doc from Scripture menu).

==Silas 2.05-1.030 by Jim, 9 Feb 2007==
 * Added Install Booklet Macros button to Booklet style form, and removed installing booklet macros from Install Silas.doc. Modified FAQ document to match.
 * Removes explicit font formatting from verse numbers and footnote markers, because Pt adds it for RTL text.
 * If you edit the checking table for a language/project, you edit a specific file for that project, and Languages.ini remembers its name.

==Silas 2.05-1.028 by Jim, 5 Feb 2007==
 * Updated screenshot of Scripture menu in template text, and the description of menus, booklet macros etc.
 * In Install.doc, moved check for custom file to the right place, about destination, not source. Also using a boolean argument to put ref to filename in a safer place.
 * In FAQ file, comments on the two custom files now match the program logic.

==Silas 2.05-1.027 by Kim, 3 Feb 2007==
 * Button in Proofs dialog to bring up checking table for editing.
 * Inserted checking table is resized to fit margins, like old v was.
 * Install: if Custom_styles.txt and Checking Table.doc are already in template folder, they're not saved and overwritten. 
	
==Silas 2.05-1.026 by Jim, 3 Feb 2007==
 * Checking table in ID footers now comes from an included file in template folder that people can edit. Install protects their version in "old versions" folder.
 * Custom_styles.txt now copied to Pt settings folder, and preserved in "old versions" during updates.

==Silas 2.05-1.025 by Kim, 1 Feb 2007==
 * Fixed bug in FormatForProofPrintout when canceling this macro from the dialog, redid Cancel variable for both Format macros
 * Reordered FormatForHalfPage to make the dialog show faster
 * Changed LineSpacing menu item from toggle to submenu, LineSpacing button to dialog
 * More tweaks to Scripture menu items

==Silas 2.05-1.024 by Jim, 29 Jan 2007==
 * Fixed bug in InstallScrTemplate module that prevented self-updating.
 * Added question to FAQ file about printing in different scripts.

==Silas 2.05-1.023 by Kim, 21 Jan 2007==
Fixed two bugs in 1.020
Added dialog to Format for Proof Printouts: formatting choices for this printout
==Silas 2.05-1.020 by Jim, 14 Jan 2007==
Changed Install Silas to check global variable before offering to install booklet macros.
Now uses version number, so booklet macros can be updated.

==Silas 2.05-1.018 by Jim, 11 Jan 2007==

-Perhaps add key(s) to Inifile to note out-of-date stylenames -- done.

-Fixed addition of ID line and bookname that could end up in Verse Number style.

==Silas 2.05-1.016 by Jim, 9 Jan 2007==
Cropped picture of final message in "Install Silas.doc" so it wouldn't look like a button people could click.

-CreateIniFile in LangData needs to be updated so it won't make [SilasVersion] any more. -- fixed.
-add messages if Recent_Styles.txt or Original_Styles.txt are called. -- done.

-TE_Styles.txt now looks as if it should handle all the styles that come out of TE in an RTF.

==Silas 2.05-1.015 by Kim, 31 Dec 2006==
Fixed problem with footnote spacing. Also made Footer and checking table styles stay single-spaced.

Fixed problem with Booklet Macro installation.

Changed Latest_Styles.txt to Custom_Styles.txt. This control file is used for customizing USFM standard, so 
it's labeled accordingly. The other control files are used for updating to the latest "Standard" stylenames
in USFM.STY as distributed by the PT team.

Added subs ZoomSet and ZoomRecall to return to previous view.zoom after running jobs. Cleaned up subs to use
ZoomSet at start, and SetDefaultView (which calls ZoomRecall among other things) rather than 
ActiveDocument...View=PageOrPrintView at end of subs. Then if user sets a different zoom it won't change 
after every job. Also cleaned up a few places where screen updating caused a flashing image 
(switched order of calls at end of some subs).
