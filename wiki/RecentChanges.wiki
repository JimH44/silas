#summary Summary of recent changes, to version 2.05-1.040
Revision History for Silas.DOT

=NEEDED=

 * Provide drop-down list of 3-letter booknames in ID form?--only aesthetic value during  setup; the bookname isn't used for anything nor is it visible (except for ID footers in Proofs). We could do it with a txt file such as !Recent_Styles.txt.
 * Add horizontal rule between intro and Scr text even if single-column?
 * (eventually) add custom `\z*` style support, probably copy the style into the template so it doesn't hang up, perhaps open edit style dialog to format char styles right.
 * check into more automated picture placement (see Toolbox macro by Steve White)
 * Work out how to avoid headers and footers being displaced in proof printouts when there are wide right margins and double-sided layout.
 * To solve the problem of lines not matching up, think about having a blank line with "keep with next" attribute before each section heading, instead of setting Space before in the `\s` style. -- coming in a later build.

==Silas 2.05-1.040 by Jim, 9 Apr 2007==

 * Fixed bug in line spacing dialog if user cancels.
 * Fixed bug in making filename for custom checking table.
 * Even margins now one inch each side, now for Letter-sized paper as well as A4.
 * Fixed font for `_Heading_Base`, now inherited properly. Also, Advanced button refers to Heading font, as does the message in !changeFont routine.
 * Moved module !AttachUSFMTemplate from Silas.dot to Install Silas.doc in the hope of fixing the problem with people being unable to copy it to Normal.dot sometimes.
 * Added `\q4` style, and adjusted indentations for `\q#` styles to reduce ambiguity.
 * Size of `\r` changed to 90% of normal, and `\mr` to 110% of normal.
 * Fixed reference to menu item "Set language and paper size".
 * Fixed bug, spacing before `\rq` style now set to zero.
 * Changed "Chapter Drop" style to "`_Chapter_Drop`", to avoid risk of matching Like "`c*`" tests.
 * Now deleting replaced styles again in !StyleNames_RenameText, to avoid risk of their matching "Like" tests spuriously.
 * Fixed missing error description messages by moving "On Error goto 0" below the Err.Description reference.
 * Fixed problem with Japanese Word doing box for no-break space after verse numbers.
 * Added options to make hyphens be non-breaking in Proof printouts and/or thin no-break spaces in Booklets, so translators can have verb phrases group more closely together.

 * Added table of contents and info about hyphens to FAQ file.
 * Rearranged macros in Install Silas.doc to help people with Word 2000 installation failure recover better.

 * Fixed problem with checking to see if variables exist, now that all modules are Option Explicit, using separate module which is not, called "Exists"
 * !FixQuotes no longer finishes with some text selected.

 * Name of checking table for this language remembered better, in !dbLanguageListFromIni.frm.
 * When we are processing all the footnotes, sometimes Word can't find one of them. This problem now ignored, and that footnote skipped.

==Silas 2.05-1.034 by Jim, 20 Feb 2007==

 * Fixed bug in adding fixed spaces after verse numbers: infinite loop if there is no text following a verse number.
 * Avoided random crashes by making all modules Option Explicit and putting a Dim statement for each variable.
 * Fixed setting of `.LineSpacingRule` value, and some other wrong data references.

==Silas 2.05-1.030 by Jim, 9 Feb 2007==
 * Added Install Booklet Macros button to Booklet style form, and removed installing booklet macros from Install Silas.doc. Modified FAQ document to match.
 * Removes explicit font formatting from verse numbers and footnote markers, because Pt adds it for RTL text.
 * If you edit the checking table for a language/project, you edit a specific file for that project, and Languages.ini remembers its name.

 * Updated screenshot of Scripture menu in template text, and the description of menus, booklet macros etc.
 * In Install.doc, moved check for custom file to the right place, about destination, not source. Also using a boolean argument to put ref to filename in a safer place.
