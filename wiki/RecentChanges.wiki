Revision History for Silas.DOT

=NEEDED=

 * Provide drop-down list of 3-letter booknames in ID form? -- only aesthetic value during setup; the bookname isn't used for anything nor is it visible (except for ID footers in Proofs). We could do it with a txt file such as	Recent_Styles.txt.
 * Add horizontal rule between intro and Scr text even if single-column?
 * (eventually) add custom \z* style support, probably just copy the style into the template so it doesn't hang up. Perhaps note to user about adding to template & formatting it as desired so it'll update next time.

 * check into more automated picture placement (see Toolbox macro by Steve White)
 * Work out how to avoid headers and footers being displaced in proof printouts when there are wide right margins and double-sided layout.
 * To solve the problem of lines not matching up, think about having a blank line with "keep with next" attribute before each section heading, instead of setting Space before in the \s style.
 * Make Silas handle \cl as described in USFM documentation.
 * Make input boxes save as Unicode (if appropriate)
