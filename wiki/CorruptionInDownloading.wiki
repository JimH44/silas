#summary How to check to see if the download happened properly

= If the downloaded file won't run . . . =

The download may have failed, and the downloaded file might be too short, or corrupted.


= How to check =

When you try to run the installation program you just downloaded, you may get a message that the file is corrupt. If that happens, you could check the checksum, which is listed on the _Downloads_ page. 

(Open the _Downloads_ page and click on the _Summary_ for the file you want to download (it might be, "Silas installation file"). 

Another page will open, listing the SHA1 checksum.) 
(SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm)

In this case, the page that will open is
http://code.google.com/p/silas/downloads/detail?name=USFM%20instructions-v2.05-Setup.exe&can=2&q=

and the checksum listed there is
39b2f1c2cf64c82daf20450080b12c3d050c1cce

You can get a program that will calculate the SHA1 value for the file you have downloaded,
AccuHash, at http://www.accuhash.com/

Install it, then run it and Browse to the file you downloaded. 
Set the Hash type to SHA1, and the Encoding to Hexadecimal.

Operate the Calculate button, and the program will calculate the SHA1 value for the file.
On the web page for the Silas download, select the SHA1 value, copy it to the clipboard
and paste it into the Original hash value field and operate the Compare button.
If the two values match, the download happened properly. 
If not, download again and check again.
