#summary Would you like to be a tester of pre-release versions of Silas?
#labels Featured,Phase-QA

Sometimes the people most stressed by computers are the ones who find
the bugs for us :-(

We would like to have a list of volunteers who would not be too thrown
by the odd crash, who could download a new version of Silas and test
it, perhaps in more than one version of Word, even in systems set for
different languages, such as Swedish, Japanese, French or Spanish.

And we'd love to have someone test it in Word 2007.

I would like to have two lists:
==Alpha testers==
 the most adventurous, who can be the first guinea pigs
==Beta testers==
 those who would rather have others find the most glaring errors first

==If you would like to help==
If you would like to join either list (or both), pls send an email
back to me at

   mailto:Jim.Henderson44@gmail.com

stating your intention.

I'll compile the list and share it with Kim, but no further.

If you wish, you can ask us to send notifications of new versions to
test with your address in the BCC field, so the other recipients of
the message won't see your email address.

So an easy way for you to respond would be to copy the next few lines
to the clip board, click on my email address above, and paste into the
message, then fill in the blanks and send:

   Alpha test list: yes/no

   Beta test list: yes/no

   Use BCC field: yes/no

Thanks for considering this request,
   Jim
